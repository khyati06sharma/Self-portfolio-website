    <h2>About <span>The Author</span></h2>
    <p>
      My name is Khyati Sharma, and I am a 19-year-old student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications
      (BCA) degree from Dezyne Ecole College, Ajmer. I am in my second year of study and have a growing passion for web
      development, especially the creative and designing aspects of it. I enjoy building visually appealing and
      user-friendly websites while learning how functionality and design work together. Although I consider myself
      average in coding, I am comfortable working with programming languages like C and C++. My ultimate goal is to
      become a skilled web developer, and I am continuously working on improving my technical abilities, design sense,
      and problem-solving skills through learning and practice.
